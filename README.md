# giter
A more-efficient git sdk of golang.

This project based on https://github.com/go-git/go-git.

## Comparison with go-git

I create this project just because I could not use the go-git efficiently. It, go-git, works like exactly like git does, but I can't easily get what I want when I need use in actual projects.
